# Sorting Algorithm

## What is Sorting algorithm about?
- it is used to rearrange a given array or list of elements according to a comparison operator on the elements. The comparison operator is used to decide the new order of elements in the respective data structure


- Below are the task done

* 0-bubble_sort.c, 0-O: Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algo
* 1-insertion_sort_list.c, 1-O: Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
* 2-selection_sort.c, 2-O: Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
* 3-quick_sort.c, 3-O: Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm
* sort.h: protptypes of all functions
